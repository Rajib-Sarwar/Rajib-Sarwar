Qibrah is a comprehensive, production-grade iOS application that showcases advanced native capabilities, high-performance rendering, and modern declarative design. 

* **Architecture & State Management:** Architected entirely with **SwiftUI** and modern reactive frameworks (**Combine, async/await**), establishing robust data flow and state management for complex, data-heavy interfaces.
* **Custom UI & Advanced Layouts:** Engineered highly customized, dynamic UI components—including complex flow layouts and dynamic Right-to-Left (RTL) rendering engines—overcoming standard framework limitations to deliver pixel-perfect designs.
* **Hardware & Framework Integration:** Integrated advanced iOS capabilities, including **AVAudioEngine** and **SFSpeechRecognizer**, to build real-time, highly responsive interactive features with seamless hardware synchronization.
* **Performance Optimization:** Optimized app footprint by implementing efficient data decoding, caching strategies, and structured concurrency to ensure smooth 60fps scrolling on complex list views.

### 🚀 Core Engineering Prowess

As a Senior Engineer, my focus extends beyond UI implementation into full-scale mobile system architecture, concurrency, and platform security.

* **iOS Architecture & Modernization:** Spearheading migrations from legacy UIKit to **SwiftUI**, building reactive, state-driven interfaces using MVVM and Clean Architecture.
* **Android Build Systems & DevOps:** Architecting multi-dimensional build variants using **Gradle Kotlin DSL**. Engineering matrix-strategy **GitHub Actions pipelines** and **Fastlane** for automated concurrent builds, dynamic cryptographic signing, and zero-touch deployments.
* **Dependency & Scale Management:** Resolving complex multi-variant dependency conflicts, utilizing Swift Package Manager (SPM) for iOS modularization, and isolating SDK-specific components to support extensive white-label applications.
* **Complex Integrations:** Building advanced GPS routing solutions (**GraphHopper, CoreLocation**) and optimizing secure, low-latency payment systems (**Payrix, Apple Pay, Google Pay, NFC hardware integrations**).
